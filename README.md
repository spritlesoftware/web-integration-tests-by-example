### Web Integration Tests - By Example
RSpec Capybara examples for Chennai Ruby Meetup

The whole idea is to walkthrough the integration test by examples. No theory.

Lets create a simple step-by-step examples illsutrating ..

#### Step 1

* Simple page texts validation (assert for helloworld on a direct page view, assert for text inside a tab, assert of text inside an accordion and so on)
* Simple form filling (input field, radio buttons, checkbox, select box)
* Form filling and validations text assertions (example: Invalid email id)
* Form submission and content generation assertions
* Ajax based form submission assertions
* Integrate Devise and show an example of form submission

#### Step 2

* Show Factory girl example by creating one model and then two models (post, post and comments)
 
#### Step 3

* Run the whole test with capybara and selenium, capybara and phantomjs, capybara and capybara-webkit
